# ComputerCraft: Restitched with Polymer

Doing things no one else did...

## What is this?
This is a port of CC: Restitched (which by itself is port of CC: Tweaked, 
continuation of original ComputerCraft), modified in a way to allow nearly
all functionality of regular version to work purely server side (Vanilla client can join
servers using it and have all functionality!). It still requires server to run on Fabric
or Quilt, so keep that in mind!

If you are interested about ComputerCraft and how to use it check
[page of CC:R](https://github.com/cc-tweaked/cc-restitched/#readme).

This version should be nearly identical in case of usage and functionality,
excluding different guis and no support for DFPWM/playing dynamic audio from speakers.

## How to use uis
To move mouse pointer you just need to move same way as you would rotate camera.

To input text directly into PC, type `/` and follow it by your input

To run macros/shortcuts, send a message starting with `;` (press tab to list all available). 
You can input multiple by separating them with `;`. Some of them take arguments after space (mostly number of reapeats)

To exit guis press Ctrl + Q.
